## Vulnerabilities

We encourage security researchers and members of the community to report
vulnerabilities through the following contact methods:

- **Email:** [cna@erlef.org](mailto:cna@erlef.org)
- **GPG Key:** For encrypted communications, please use our GPG key:
  - **Public Key:** [GPG Public Key](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/38BD201B397E28F1F3D93EC76E031A811F266E21)
  - **Fingerprint:** `38BD 201B 397E 28F1 F3D9 3EC7 6E03 1A81 1F26 6E21` 

## Report via GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting

We also support direct integration with [GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

If you're using GitHub to report your vulnerability, you can invite our CNA
Points of Contact (PoCs) directly into your private advisory instead of reaching
out via email.

### Steps to collaborate with us on a GitHub Advisory

1. **CVE Identifier**  
   - When initially creating the advisory, choose:  
     **"Request CVE ID later"**

2. **Collaborators**  
   - Add the following GitHub users as collaborators to the private advisory:
     - `@IngelaAndin` – Ingela Andin (Affiliation: OTP Core Contributor)
     - `@maennchen` – Jonatan Männchen (Affiliation: CISO Erlang Ecosystem
       Foundation)
     - `@voltone` – Bram Verburg (Affiliation: Erlang Ecosystem Foundation
       Security WG Chair)

3. **Assigning a CVE ID**  
   - Once the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation CNA has reviewed the report and
     decided to issue a CVE ID, edit the advisory:
     - Set **CVE Identifier** to **"I have an existing CVE ID"**
     - Enter the CVE number we provide you into the **Existing CVE** field

This approach provides a secure and streamlined workflow for submitting and
triaging vulnerabilities within the GitHub ecosystem.
