The chart below shows the most common weakness classes found in vulnerabilities across the
Erlang ecosystem. Understanding which weakness types recur most often helps library authors
and application developers focus their security efforts where they matter most.

Each CVE is mapped to its [CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)](https://cwe.mitre.org/) class
using the CWE hierarchy. Individual weakness types (Base and Variant level) are rolled up to
their nearest **Class-level** ancestor, so related weaknesses are grouped together rather than
scattered across many small slices. Weakness classes with fewer than 2 CVEs are folded into
"Other". Each CVE is counted once per unique class it references.
